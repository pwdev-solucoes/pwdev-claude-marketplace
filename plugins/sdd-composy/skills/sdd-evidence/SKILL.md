  Discover, build, verify, and optionally export (HTML, optional PDF) the evidence
  manifest of one SDD Composy task in evidence_required, routing it toward

  'juntar as evidências da task', 'gerar o relatório de evidências', 'verify the
  evidence manifest'. Do NOT use to run tests (sdd-qa), review code (sdd-review), or
  inspect the trace (sdd-trace).

# SDD Evidence

Build, verify, and optionally export the portable evidence manifest of one task with the
bundled `scripts/sdd_evidence.py` helper.

Language: when an operation emits human-facing summaries, run `scripts/sdd_language.py <repo-root>` and use the persisted language; on `not_initialized`, return it with `next_action: run_init`. Localization rules: `references/language.md`.

## Operations

1. `sdd_evidence.py discover <root>` — a deterministic, read-only inventory of the existing
   task evidence under the confined evidence root, before creating anything.
2. `sdd_evidence.py build <input.json> <root> <manifest>` — rebuild the manifest, preserving
   the source files and recording relative paths, SHA-256 digests, known enums, and sanitized
   content. Never mutate existing evidence while rebuilding.
3. `sdd_evidence.py verify <manifest> <root>` — required before routing a task from
   `evidence_required` to `review_required`. The task engine remains the authority and rejects
   missing, stale, or unapproved evidence.
4. `sdd_evidence.py export <manifest> <root> <output> [--workspace-root <repo>]` — HTML report.
   With the evidence root at `tasks/prd-<slug>/evidences/`, the output may be anywhere in that
   PRD bundle (normally `tasks/prd-<slug>/evidence-report.html`) and the workspace language is
   read from the repository root without `--workspace-root`. PDF is optional: only when
   explicitly requested, it must fail if expected screenshot images cannot load, and it may
   report that no PDF backend is available.

Never infer approval, bypass lifecycle guards, or use paths outside the task root. Return the
manifest and verification result unchanged to the caller.

## Read when

- `references/artifacts.md` ("Synchronization and evidence") — building a manifest, or a path,
  digest, or enum is rejected.

Safety: Do not commit, push, or publish. Do not read or expose `.env`, credentials, tokens, private keys, certificates, or fleet environment files. Full contract: `references/safety.md`.
